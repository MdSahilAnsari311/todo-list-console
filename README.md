# Todo List (Console Version)

A basic Todo List app that runs in the browser console using JavaScript.

## Commands
- `list` — show all tasks
- `add` — add a new task (prompt asks for the task)
- `delete` — delete task by index (use `list` to see indexes)
- `quit` — exit the app

## How to run
Open `index.html` in a browser. Use the prompt dialog to interact with the app.
Open the browser console (F12) to see the output messages.

## What I learned
- Arrays and loops
- User input with `prompt`
- Basic validation and UX improvements
